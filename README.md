# eSportsProMapStrats

The initial idea started with Rainbow Six Siege. Where many people don't know basic/good set ups on maps. So i thought what if I watch pro games and remake there defences for all to see.

(turns out r6 siege's official maps are messed up so this more annoying than intial thought)
